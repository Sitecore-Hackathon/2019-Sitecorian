# Documentation

The documentation for this years Hackathon must be provided as a readme in Markdown format as part of your submission. 

You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

Examples of things to include are the following.

## Dataflow

Salesforce exposes a cookie in the browser on a user visit. Salesforce data is always read directly from the cookie by the Sitecore(but doesnâ€™t do a round trip it would read from the http request) and will not store it.
